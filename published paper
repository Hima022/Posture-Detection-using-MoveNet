Abstract: Posture detection plays a critical role in
applications such as fitness tracking, ergonomic
assessment, and rehabilitation. Traditional methods
for posture evaluation often demand intricate
hardware setups and specialized software, posing
challenges for broad adoption. This project introduces
MoveNet, a cutting-edge machine learning model
designed to serve as the core of a real-time posture
detection system. MoveNet efficiently estimates human
poses using a single camera, identifying key body
landmarks with high precision. Tensor Flow Lite
powers the system and leverages Python for real-time
processing in machine learning applications, ensuring
cross-platform compatibility without the need for
specialized hardware. By providing accurate posture
detection and feedback on body alignment, MoveNet
demonstrates adaptability to a wide array of use cases,
including fitness coaching, rehabilitation exercises, and
ergonomic monitoring.
I. INTRODUCTION
Posture detection plays a key role in current
applications such as fitness tracking, ergonomic
assessment, and rehabilitation. However, existing
approaches for analyzing and monitoring human
posture sometimes need more support due to their
reliance on complicated hardware setups and
specialized software. These approaches can be
expensive, difficult to apply at scale, and tough for
users who lack access to specialized equipment.
Moreover, many posture detection systems struggle
to offer real-time feedback, making them less useful
in dynamic, real-world contexts.
To solve these obstacles, the invention of a
lightweight, precise, and efficient posture-detecting
system is needed. This research proposes the usage
of MoveNet, a state-of-the-art machine learning
model designed for real-time human position
prediction. By employing a single camera and
integrating TensorFlow Lite with Python,

II. LITERATURE SURVEY
Researchers have focused a lot of effort on human
body posture recognition because of its many
applications and important challenges. It can be
used for everything from simple posture detection to
sophisticated behavior analysis in surveillance
systems. These results are essential for refining
methods for identifying and expressing body
position. The applications and basic framework of
human body posture identification are examined in
this study. It offers a TensorFlow-based posture
detection technique to track people's proper posture
while they're doing different tasks.P. Kaushik et al.
[1] also compare two well-known posture estimation
techniques and discuss their benefits and drawbacks.
Hua-Tsung, Chen, et al. [2] demonstrate in this
study employs computer vision techniques to
analyse images or videos of yoga practitioners and
identify the different poses they are performing in
order to identify and categorise yoga positions using
machine learning and neural networks. This
technology could be useful in many contexts,
including yoga. Internet studios, fitness centres, and
yoga classes. A large collection of annotated images
of people in various yoga poses is gathered, used to
train a machine learning or neural network model,
and then used to automatically recognise and
classify yoga poses in new images or videos.
With an emphasis on both 2D and 3D human pose
estimation, Hruthika, Jupalle, et al[3] investigate
developments in human pose estimation through
deep learning techniques. It presents a unique video-
based 2D posture estimate technique employing a
multi-scale Temporal Consistency Encoding (TCE)
module and draws attention to the difficulties
presented by occlusion, depth ambiguity, and a lack
of training data in real-world situations. This
module enhances temporal consistency and
performance by utilizing spatial pyramids and
learnable offset fields. The article suggests a self-
supervised 2D-to-3D lifting model for 3D pose
estimation that uses transform re-projection losses
and geometric priors to do away with the necessity

for large amounts of 3D ground truth data. Findings
show competitive performance on common datasets,
highlighting the model's efficacy and
generalisability for practical uses in fields such as
augmented reality, sports analysis, and human-
computer interaction.
Upadhyay A et al. [4] discuss a deep learning-based
model, Y_PN-MSSD, designed to recognize seven
yoga poses with 99.88% accuracy. The model
combines Pose-Net for feature point detection and
Mobile-Net SSD for human detection. The process
is divided into three stages: data collection, model
training, and pose recognition. The model helps
users track and correct their yoga posture in real-
time, outperforming the Pose-Net CNN model in
accuracy. Future work will focus on training with
more yoga poses, addressing challenges like
occlusion and lighting, and adding features like
audio alerts for correct posture, aiming to build a
professional real-time yoga trainer application.
Samkari E et al. [5] analyze deep learning
techniques for 2D human pose estimation (HPE)
from images and videos, summarizing 107 articles
from 2014 to 2023. It categorizes methods into
single-person vs. multiple-person pose estimation
and image vs. video-based approaches, highlighting
models like HRNet, OpenPose, and Stacked
Hourglass that improve accuracy. Challenges
remain in multi-pose estimation, particularly in
crowded scenes and occlusion. For video, offline
methods are accurate but slow, while online
methods balance accuracy and efficiency, though
real-time performance is still difficult. The review
emphasizes the need for more research on video-
based HPE, real-time applications, smaller
networks, and methods to handle occlusion and
crowd scenes.
Parashar, D. et al. [6], a deep learning model based
on MoveNet and MediaPipe is used to automatically
detect yoga positions. The suggested technique
skeletonizes input yoga photos using key points and
MediaPipe. MediaPipe is used to extract the main
features and skeletons of people, and the MoveNet
model processes the generated images to precisely
determine the right yoga positions. The LDY yoga
dataset was used to assess the model's performance,
and MoveNet's deep learning architecture produced
an accuracy of 99.50%. We tested the method using
four different models to determine its robustness,
and the findings showed that the suggested method
performed better in yoga pose detection than the
current methods. Furthermore, an accuracy
comparison revealed that our strategy outperformed
alternative techniques.
P. . Daphal et al.[7] focuses on human position
detection techniques used in robotics, sports, fitness,
fall detection, human-computer interface, and
motion analysis, among other surveillance
applications. It looks into how well-suited the
current single-person and multi-person pose
detection methods are in terms of efficiency and
real-time compatibility. The goal of the project is to
enhance pose detection-based systems, especially
for applications like fall detection that can save
lives. The survey also covers the creation of an
effective deep learning model for human pose
identification that is tailored for machine learning-
based single-person pose estimation and can be used
with both photos and videos.
Parashar et al.[8] presents an automated technique
for identifying yoga poses that makes use of the
MoveNet deep learning model and the MediaPipe
methodology. The suggested method uses
MediaPipe to skeletonize input yoga images using
key points. MoveNet then processes the images to
identify yoga positions precisely. When tested on
the LDY yoga dataset, the model's accuracy was
99.50%. The MoveNet and MediaPipe combo
performed better than the current approaches,
according to testing with four distinct models. Better
alignment and participation in yoga practice are
encouraged by this method's useful applications in
real-time pose correction, progress tracking, and
personalized virtual yoga instruction.
Roggio,Federico et al.[9] presents a novel machine-
learning technique for postural analysis that offers
clear classification and less subjectivity, with
substantial therapeutic promise. This effective, non-
invasive technique may improve individualized
physical therapy and ergonomic care. Our study
provides normative data, confirming its reliability
and relevance in evaluating healthy adult posture.
We identified sex-related differences and very
reliable postural metrics. Crucially, postural features
like limb length and variations in shoulder-hip width
that are not influenced by sex were identified using
cluster analysis. These results point to possible new
directions for ML-driven posture classification.

Using MediaPipe and a deep learning model based
on MoveNet, Parashar et al. [10] presented a novel
automated method for identifying yoga postures.
For critical point-based skeletonization in the
performance of the proposed model, the MediaPipe
approach is employed. The MediaPipe technique is
utilised to process input yoga images in order to
extract each person's key characteristics and
skeletons within the suggested framework. The
normalised and skeletonised images are then loaded
into the MoveNet model, which enables accurate
identification of suitable yoga poses. The LDY yoga
dataset has been used to evaluate the performance of
the proposed model. they achieved a 99.50%
accuracy rate using MoveNet's deep learning
architecture.To test the suggested method's
resilience, they selected four distinct models. The
collected findings demonstrate that the suggested
approach, which used MediaPipe and MoveNet,
performed better for yoga posture detection than the
current approaches. Furthermore, they evaluated the
accuracy of the results against the current
approaches and discovered that the suggested
approach performed better for detecting yoga poses.
Real-time position correction, progress tracking, and
personalized virtual yoga instruction are all made
possible by yoga pose identification, which
promotes better alignment and practice
participation.
III. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
This project uses TensorFlow Lite and MoveNet
Lightning to construct a real-time posture detection
system. Using OpenCV, live video from a camera is
captured, and each frame is preprocessed and
resized before sending them into the MoveNet
model. The model's rendering of important body
landmarks on the live video feed shows the user's
posture. The posture detection and visualization
system is provided with accuracy by establishing
linkages between body components based on a
confidence threshold. The project is quite flexible
since it makes effective use of TensorFlow Lite to
allow real-time processing even on low-power
devices. This posture recognition system can be
utilized for a variety of tasks, such as fitness
tracking, rehabilitation activities, and ergonomic
assessments because it functions flawlessly across
platforms.

IV.1PROPOSED1WORK
Deep learning techniques (neural networks,
computer vision) are required for the difficult task
of real-time classification posture detection. This is
the first of a series of articles where we will detail
how to create an application for posture detection
utilizing neural networks and TensorFlow MoveNet.
You can see that the model is a TensorFlow
MoveNet Model which is an accurate and fast key
point detector for body. It identifies points of the
body. This model on TF hub offers two models that
are Thunder and Lightning. In real time, they both
run quickly and accurately. This means that these
models can be effective on modern desktops (like
those configured with an NVIDIA 3060 GP) up and
modern laptops. The model is popularly used within
health and fitness.
Tensorflow moveNet is bottom-up approach, which
localise key points from human body with help of
heatmap. In this architecture, there are two focused

components: a group of prediction heads and
extractor points. Prediction schemes (CenterNet
which used on it for speed and delicacy) Models are
trained using the object detection API of
TensorFlow. They extract points from MoveNet and

person.
V. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
Result and Analysis: The system's usage of
TensorFlow MoveNet for real-time posture
detection demonstrates its ability to efficiently
extract and classify significant points of the human
body. The process begins with data collecting, and
input might take the form of image files or real-time
video feeds. To ensure that the data meets the
requirements of the model, preprocessing techniques
like downsizing and normalization are employed to
maximize efficiency.
Key Points Detection and Preprocessing:
TensorFlow Using a bottom-up methodology,
MoveNet precisely locates important locations on
the human body by using heatmaps. For various
application cases, it provides two variations,
Thunder and Lightning, that strike a compromise
between speed and accuracy. Lightning is optimized
for real-time performance on devices with less
processing power, whereas Thunder is made for
great precision. These devices are appropriate for
real-world applications since they can efficiently
handle contemporary desktops and laptops.
The identified essential points are taken out and
transformed into a CSV file, which is then fed into a
neural network. This conversion makes it easier to
perform additional analysis, including classifying or
assessing posture. The neural network is guaranteed
to receive high-quality, structured data for precise
predictions thanks to the preprocessing.
Neural Network categorization: The data is placed
into a neural network that carries out categorization
after the important points have been extracted. The
system can recognize particular body poses thanks
to this categorization stage, which groups the
detected postures into categories. Labeled datasets
are used to train the neural network, guaranteeing
accurate and dependable predictions. The neural
network's integration with TensorFlow MoveNet
improves the system's capacity to manage a variety
of posture alterations.
Web Application Integration: A web application
developed with the React framework is integrated
with the system. Users can provide real-time video
feeds or submit photographs using an intuitive
interface. The web application uses the neural
network to identify the posture after processing the

IJIRT 171529 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE RESEARCH IN TECHNOLOGY 386
input through the MoveNet model and extracting
important elements.
Real-Time Performance: The system's real-time
feature guarantees that posture identification
happens without hiccups, which makes it ideal for
applications in fitness tracking, health monitoring,
and other fields needing immediate feedback.
TensorFlow's Object Detection API in conjunction
with the MoveNet model guarantees quick
processing without sacrificing precision.
Analysis: The deployed system has several
advantages:Accuracy: The exact identification of
important locations is guaranteed by the application
of heatmaps and deep learning techniques.
Real-Time Detection: Real-time processing of video
streams is a big plus, especially for applications like
rehabilitation and fitness tracking.
Integration with Web Applications: The system's
practical usability is demonstrated by its smooth
integration with a React-based frontend.
Scalability: Training the model on more data to
identify more intricate postures or movements is one
simple extension made possible by the modular
approach.
But there are also areas where the system may be
improved: Hardware Dependency: Although the
models are effective, they only work well if there
are enough computational resources available,
particularly in Thunder mode.
Generalization: The variety and calibre of the
training data affect posture detection accuracy.
In summary, the system successfully illustrates
TensorFlow MoveNet's potential for real-time
posture detection. It strikes a balance between
accuracy, speed, and usability by integrating web
applications, neural network-based categorization,
and effective preprocessing. This makes it a great
tool for practical health and fitness applications,
with room for more feature additions and
optimization.
VI.1LIMITATIONS
There are various issues with the present code.
Lighting conditions have a significant impact on
posture detection accuracy and can affect
performance in overexposed or low-light
environments. Since the system depends on visual
cues for detection, accuracy is also impacted by
frame resolution. Multi-person scenarios are not
supported by the code, which is intended for single-
person detection. It also doesn't check to see if the
video capture object has been successfully
initialized and doesn't handle video input errors.
Lower-end systems may have processing lag when it
comes to real-time pose identification, and the code
cannot understand or follow movements over time.
Additionally, it needs a camera and enough
processing power, which restricts its use in specific
settings.
VII.1FUTURE1SCOPE
There are several approaches to improving the code.
Support for multi-person detection and sophisticated
pose analysis, including gesture or activity
recognition, could be future additions. It would be
more functional to incorporate AI models for
applications such as gesture-based controls, dance
analysis, and fitness tracking. When video input
fails or no posture is identified, robust error
handling should be put in place to deal with the
situation. Real-time processing would be facilitated
by efficiency enhancements like GPU acceleration.
Additionally, improving background noise filtering
and making the application cross-platform and
cross-device compatible could increase its usability.
VIII. CONCLUSION
The project effectively uses TensorFlow MoveNet
to demonstrate a real-time posture detection system.
It efficiently detects and categorizes human body
poses by fusing image processing, neural networks,
and TensorFlow's pose detection features. Scalable,
the technology can be included in more general
applications like ergonomics analysis, fitness
tracking, or health monitoring systems. TensorFlow
MoveNet is a dependable model for real-time
human pose estimation applications due to its
excellent accuracy and speed. Future research might
look into enhancing classification models or
extending the use to more subjects at once.
